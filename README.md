# GuiHelpers

Programs that access parts of the OS that normally require a compiler.

There are many examples around to access things like the mouse cursor, system tray, dock and other parts of the GUI.  But they all assume that you have a full compiler chain installed, and that you are happy writing C/C++ to access OS calls.  There is no need for this, we should just be able to run a program and get the data that we want.  These programs do that.

## Hotcorners

Prints a message and runs a program when you push the cursor to the top left corner of the screen.

	hotcorner.exe path\to\program.exe
